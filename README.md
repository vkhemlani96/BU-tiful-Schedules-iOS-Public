# BU-tiful Schedules
BU-tiful Schedules is the future of Boston Universityâ€™s class registration process. The application is designed to allow users to find their perfect schedule by simply entering the course codes of the classes they plan on taking. It speeds up the process by displaying a list all possible schedules (without class overlap) in graphical form in less than a second. The application then allows for users to filter out schedules based on the following criteria:
* Desired Professors
* No Classes on Specified Days of the Week
* Earliest Start Time/Latest End Time
* Available Seats

Upon choosing a schedule, the application displays more information about each class including the specific section numbers, professor names and class locations. At this point, the user can save the graphical view of the schedule to their phone and even add the classes to their Boston University Semester Planner in one click!
